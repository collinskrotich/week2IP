## Project description
>This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.
The application prompts a user to enter their birthday and gender on the browser.
The application then outputs the user's Akan name(from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.)
Here are Ghanian day names.
